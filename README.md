## ✨ Core Features

CodeCup is packed with features designed to empower creators and engage the community:

-   🎥 **Video Uploads & NFT Minting**: Creators can upload coding challenge videos, which are automatically minted as NFTs on the Solana devnet using the Underdog Protocol. This gives creators true ownership of their content.
-   💰 **Solana Tipping**: Viewers can directly support their favorite creators by tipping them with SOL.
-   ⚔️ **Live Code Battles**: Challenge other creators to head-to-head coding battles, streamed live using Livepeer. The community votes for the winner in real-time.
-   🎯 **Daily Coding Challenges**: A new challenge appears every day! Users can submit their solutions and receive instant feedback and a score from an AI Judge powered by Google's Gemini model via Genkit.
-   📈 **Dynamic Leaderboards**: Track top performers across various categories, including top-voted videos, top-earning creators, most generous tippers, and country-based rankings.
-   🪙 **Creator Tokens**: Creators can launch their own SPL tokens via pump.fun and link them to their profiles, enabling a personal economy.
-   🔒 **Token-Gated Content**: Creators can restrict access to their videos, making them exclusive to holders of their creator token.
-   👤 **Rich User Profiles**: Profiles showcase a user's uploaded videos, NFT collection, achievements, and battle history.
-   🛡️ **Admin Dashboard**: A secure area for administrators to manage the platform, starting with a bug report viewer.
-   🐛 **Integrated Bug Reporting**: A simple, sitewide bug reporting system that feeds directly into the admin dashboard.
